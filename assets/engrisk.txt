       The Japanese love inventing and they are very good at <u><b>it</b></u>. But there is one inventor who has invented more things than anyone else in Japan - Dr. Nakamats. He has designed over 4,000 new inventions over the last fifty years. He is most well-known for his unusual inventions. 
       He designed many strange things such as glasses which look like eyes so you can’t notice them, shoes which have steel springs so that you can jump in them, and a pillow which stops you from falling asleep when you are driving. 
       How does he come up with these ideas? He finds listening to Beethoven helpful. But the thing that makes him most creative is holding his breath underwater. He dives into his swimming pool every day and stays underwater as long as he can. He believes that less oxygen in the brain is good for new ideas. He also dives with a pencil and a notebook which he invented. He needs to write down his ideas immediately in the water because they disappear quickly.      
       Dr. Nakamats believes that eating the right food is important for creativity, and he has invented some snacks that he says are good for your brain. He has also invented an armchair which helps to <u><b>enhance</b></u> your brainpower. He sits in the chair every day to give him more good ideas. Dr. Nakamats is now in his eighties, but he plans to live until he is 144 years old, so he still has plenty of time to develop even more new ideas.

<b><i>Read the following passage and mark the letter A, B, C, or D on your answer sheet to indicate the correct answer to each of the questions from 36 to 42.</i></b>
       Action movies are exciting and a lot of fun to watch, but they also involve scenes of great risk and danger. In the language of filmmaking, dangerous actions are called <i>stunts</i>. Who performs these stunts? This work is too dangerous for regular actors. Movie companies usually hire special stunt people to stand in for the actors in scenes that are unsafe. 
       Movie producers don’t like to let actors do their own stunt work. If the actors injure themselves, it can delay the production schedule. Using stunt people also saves time. Most stunt people have years of experience, which enables <u><b>them</b></u> to perform their stunts with a minimum of risk. It would take too long to train the actors to perform dangerous scenes safely. 
       Some people who love the <u><b>thrill</b></u> of dangerous sports such as skydiving or rock climbing think it would be easy to work as a stunt person. But it isn’t enough to be a risk-taker. Stunt performers also have to know what to do if anything goes wrong. 
       In addition to risk-taking and <u><b>meticulous</b></u> attention to detail and planning, stunt work requires being in top physical condition. Although there are a few training programmes for stunt performers, most provide only an overview of the profession. Normally, the people who attend these programmes already have experience in dangerous sports, rescue work, or the military. So the best way to prepare for a career in stunt work is to train in an area that involves strong physical conditioning and has an element of physical danger.
       Modern filmmaking techniques have changed the way some dangerous scenes are filmed. For example, computer-generated images make it possible to show stunts that would be too dangerous or expensive for real stunt people to perform. Computer-generated images are often used today to create big fight scenes, car crashes, and explosions. However, they are not always the best choice. Many audiences want to see real people perform actual stunts. Also, the rising popularity of made-for-TV movies around the world ensures that there is still plenty for stunt people in the film industry.
